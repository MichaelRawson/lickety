# lickety
Prototype system for linear resolution with splitting.

## Build
Install a Rust toolchain: [rustup](https://rustup.rs) is convenient for this.
You will also need a static PicoSAT library somewhere linkable.

```
$ cargo build --release
```

There should now be an executable at `target/release/lickety`.

## Usage
```
$ lickety --help
```
